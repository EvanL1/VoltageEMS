//! Pure-infra contract for SHM slot I/O.
//!
//! `SlotIo` is the declaration of what a "business-unaware SHM writer" can do:
//! address slots by index, write/read seqlocked cells, track dirty slots,
//! observe header state. **Nothing on this trait mentions channels, point
//! types, instances, or routing** — that is by design.
//!
//! `UnifiedWriter` (in `unified_shm.rs`) implements `SlotIo` to expose its
//! pure-infra capabilities. Its inherent methods continue to carry the
//! channel/point-type adapters; those adapters are deliberately NOT part of
//! this trait. Any caller that only needs slot-level I/O (snapshot restore,
//! pure-infra tests, future generic tools) should program against `dyn
//! SlotIo` so that the type system rejects business coupling at compile
//! time.
//!
//! This trait is intentionally not object-safe in pursuit of one thing or
//! another — it is plain `&self` so it composes with `Arc<dyn SlotIo>` if
//! callers want dynamic dispatch.
