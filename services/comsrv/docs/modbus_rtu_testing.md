# Modbus RTU Testing Guide

This document outlines how to test the Modbus RTU implementation including unit, integration and performance tests.

## Contents
1. Test architecture
2. Unit tests
3. Integration tests
4. Serial port simulator
5. Performance tests
6. Running tests
7. Troubleshooting
8. Coverage

## Test Architecture
Testing is divided into layers to ensure reliability:
- **Unit Tests** – frame encoding/decoding, CRC, timing
- **Integration Tests** – protocol factory, end-to-end communication, error handling
- **Simulators and Tools** – serial port simulator, RTU server simulator

## Running Tests
Use `cargo test` for Rust unit tests and the provided Python scripts for integration scenarios. Performance tests simulate high load against a mock server.

## Troubleshooting
Check the logs generated by the simulators and ensure serial ports are accessible. Timing issues are often related to incorrect serial settings.
